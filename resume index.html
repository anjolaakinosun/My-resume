    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>For the past 3 years, I have been into building products and if there's one thing I have discovered about myself, it's the 
        fact that I really love solving problem. Therefore, due to this desire, I decided to go into Full-Stack. So I won't just 
        design, but would be able to build as well. </p>
